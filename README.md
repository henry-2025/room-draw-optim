## Doing simulations
1. Run preference generation to create `preferences.csv` in `optim.ipynb`. 
2. Run the AMPL program (currently `range_preferences.mod`). You will need to install the AMPL data connector for csv files from https://amplplugins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/amplcsv.html. The program terminates quickly in some circumstances.
